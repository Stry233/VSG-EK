# Visual-Story-Generation-Based-on-Emotional-and-Keyword-Scheme
In this work, we propose a narrative generation pipeline to co-create visual stories with the users. The pipeline allows the user to control events and emotions on the generated content. The pipeline includes two parts: narrative and image generation. In narrative generation, we plan the narrative based on the keywords and emotional trends in sentences and generate the following story sentence. In image generation, we use Disco Diffusion to create a visually appealing image that captures the story's main plot; we further implement object recognition to allow objects in the images to be mentioned in future story development.
