## Overview

In this work, we propose a narrative generation pipeline to co-create visual stories with the users. The pipeline allows the user to control events and emotions on the generated content. 

The pipeline includes two parts: narrative and image generation. In narrative generation, we plan the narrative based on the keywords and emotional trends in sentences and generate the following story sentence. In image generation, we use both Disco Diffusion and Stable Diffusion to create a visually appealing image that captures the story's main plot; we further implement object recognition to allow objects in the images to be mentioned in future story development.

## GUI demo

We implement a simple demo showing the deployment ver. of our framework [here](http://vsg-ek.herokuapp.com/). Please referred to the Q&A section for more information

## Evaluation

We demonstrate a performance distribution of the baseline model and the prompt-optimized model in 3,748 sets of experiments under different metrics. The blue box on the left side of each figure represents our method and the orange on the right side represents the baseline model.

## Examples

Here is several example stories you can generate using this framework.

| #    | Sentence                                       | Image                                                        |
